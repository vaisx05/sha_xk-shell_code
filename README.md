## `👋` "Step into the realm of malware exploration with open arms!"

Aloha, nerds and nerdettes! Let's geek out together. 🚀 I've embarked on an exciting journey of learning and development, starting from absolute ground zero. This repository is like my digital diary, where I'm documenting the fascinating techniques I'm discovering and implementing. **"Honestly, the main reason for diving into this project was just for the sheer joy of it—because, you know, 'do what you love' and all that jazz! Who needs placements when you've got passion, right?"**

## `🚀` THE BACKSTORY:

The backstory of this project is all about standing out from the crowd. About six months ago, I kicked off a malware project, but due to unforeseen challenges, I had to put it on pause. Now, I'm starting fresh with this new endeavor, fueled by the desire to make a mark and showcase my skills in a unique way.

## `💻` UNLEASHING CODE CHAOS:

I have a love-hate relationship with those simple programs that print patterns or calculate sums. My brain yawns at the basics, but when it's time for this coding wizardry, it's like my neurons throw a wild party! Currently on my radar:

- `🟢` [Shellcode Injection]
- `⚪` [DLL Injection]
- `⚪` [NTDLL Magic]
- `⚪` [Full NTDLL Implementation]

## `🏃` HOW TO RUN:

**STEP 1:** Clone the repo to your local storage.
**STEP 2:** Disable your systems's Windows Defenders before running this script.
**STEP 3:** Open CMD and type .\sha_xk.exe <PID>.

## `🛑` DISCLAIMER

Clearly, the stuff in this repository is all about learning, not mischief. Run these codes in a super-protected place, and it's like setting off a firework of alarms. Just to be super clear, I'm all about good vibes, not causing trouble with these programs. 
**NOTE** And hey, don't think of me as a coding genius—I'm just your everyday student, floating around in the sea of average, figuring things out in my own quirky way.
